Making use of linear relationship of RGB in terms reflectance and lighting in the log domain for denoising images (mainly, shadow removal).

Thanks to the amaizng work done by the authors of the following papers:
- https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_CVPRW_2019/papers/Autonomous%20Driving/Maxwell_Real-Time_Physics-Based_Removal_of_Shadows_and_Shading_From_Road_Surfaces_CVPRW_2019_paper.pdf

This is a work in progress, some preliminary results in the grayscale and reprojected RGB images for shadow removal:

Better results will be added soon!
